# hello-world
Basic repository for practices and notes

A little about myself: learning Python, which I have honestly said a hundred times before. So why is this time different? I was trying too hard the last times. I know that sounds ridiculous, but the fact is I wanted to win the marathon and was overly frustrated about not finishing a 5k. 

I know I can do this; I just have not yet. The 'yet' is the killer. We all suffer because of the 'yet'. I am trying to remember this. 

Hello world.
